# Lifi
An explorative study on testing the feasibility of transmitting data through light.

With Wi-Fi being the  modern and most common medium of transmission of data, it is also to be noted that it consists of  certain drawbacks such as  range of efficient data transfer, uniformity of signal strength etc., So this technology can be replaced by future proof technology namely Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) which tends to use light.
